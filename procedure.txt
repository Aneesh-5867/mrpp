config files: upto config18, it is already there. From config19 onwards have to write.

Simulations : upto config16 I've run the files (check outputs folder)

results: the order of config file naming goes like
	     ane1 = 1_sim_sim, st_line, 1 bot
		2 = "             "     2 bots
		3 = "             "     3 bots
		4 = "         , grid_5x5, 1 bot
		5 = "         ,  "        2 bots
		6 = "          ,          3 bots
		7 = 2_sim_rl, st_line, 1 bot

	(check RESULTS.ods for reference)

PROCESS : 
1)/results/old_before_sep1/  find the csv files bot_0,bot1,bot_2 with the required column headers
2)copy paste them to mrpp_sumo
3)./tpbp.sh config/ane17.yaml
4)take the generated csv files to the results folder
5)generate plots (error.py, expected_idle_plot, etc...)
6)paste the csv files, plots in their respective folder in results
7)from the generates csv files, get max true idlness, max expected idleness, max error and write them down in RESULTS.ods (in results folder)
